The **Resolve-Unpkg** library helps you to keep the unpkg links up to date by patching the unpkg URLs with the package version installed in your environment. The **Resolve-Unpkg** may be used in command line and as a webloader.

**TLDR**

> In CLI:
> ```bash
>    npm i --save-dev resolve-unpkg
>    resolve-unpkg path-to-optional-config.json
> ```
>
> Webloader:
> ```javascript
>    import scripts from '!resolve-unpkg?unpkgPrefix=unpkg.com&versionPlaceholder=a.b.c&onlyByVersionPlaceholder=true!scripts.json';
> ```

# Import

To add **Resolve-Unpkg** to the project, `cd` to the project root folder and run:

`npm i --save-dev resolve-unpkg`

This will add **Resolve-Unpkg** as a dependency to *package.json* enabling you to run the `resolve-unpkg` command manually and use resolve-unpkg as a webpack loader to resolve versions in unpkg URLs when they are imported from the JSON file.

# Configuration

By default, **Resolve-Unpkg** processes URLs with `unpkg.com` prefix in the *index.html* file and replaces the *x.x.x* version placeholders with the actual version of the packages that are installed in your local environment.

To customize the default configuration, use the following options:

| Property         | Type       | Required | Description                              | CLI | Loader |
| ---------------- | ---------- | :------: | ---------------------------------------- | :-: | :----: |
| `unpkgPrefix`    | `string`   |   No     | The prefix of the unpkg URLs. Default: `'unpkg.com'` | Yes | Yes |
| `versionPlaceholder`| `string`   |   No     | A version number placeholder to be replaced when occurs in the position of package version. Default: `'x.x.x'`  | Yes | Yes |
| `onlyByVersionPlaceholder`  | `boolean`   |   No     |  A flag that may limit the update to those URLs that contain the versionPlaceholder (e.g. x.x.x); when set to `true`, the exact package version numbers, like 1.9.1, are ignored. Default: `true`     | Yes | Yes |
| `files`    | `string[]`   |   No     | Path to file(s) to update/resolve URLs in. Default: `['index.html']` | Yes | No |
| `dist`    | `string`   |   No     | Folder where the updated file(s) should be saved. Default: overwrite original | Yes | No |

# Usage in CLI

With **Resolve-Unpkg**, you can automatically update the package versions that are mentioned in the unpkg URLs in some of your project files.

> The package versions used are those installed in your local environment.

Before you begin, prepare the resolve-unpkg configuration file to override the default options if necessary. For example:

**Sample Resolve-Unpkg configuration file**

```
{
  "unpkgPrefix": "/unpkg",
  "files": ["index.vm, index.ejs"],
  "dist": "dist/"
}
```

To update the unpkg links, run:

`resolve-unpkg [optional-config.json]`

As a result, the unpkg URLs in the provided files will be updated.

As an illustration to this process, let's consider the following file (`index.html`) :

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/spectrum-colorpicker@1.6.0/spectrum.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/jquery@x.x.x/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
``` 

If the version of the `jquery` installed in the local environment is `'2.21'`, and `spectrum-colorpicker` is `'1.6.1'`, and we run the `resolve-unpkg` with default configuration parameters, the original `index.html` file will be overwritten with this one:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/spectrum-colorpicker@1.6.0/spectrum.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/jquery@2.2.1/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Note that as the `onlyByVersionPlaceholder` is `true` by default, the older version for *spectrum-colorpicker* was not modified. 

# Usage in JS

For the unpkg links that are imported into your JS code from the JSON file, use **resolve-unpkg** loader to inject the updated versions into the URLs. To do so, update the import and provide the necessary values as parameters:

```javscript
...
import scripts from '!resolve-unpkg?unpkgPrefix=unpkg.com&versionPlaceholder=a.b.c&onlyByVersionPlaceholder=true!scripts.json';
...
```
